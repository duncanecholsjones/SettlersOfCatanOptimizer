# SettlersOfCatanOptimizer
Settlers of Catan Initial Settlement Placement Optimizer

Project developed to further Object Oriented Design knowledge.

This project uses Utilized Java, JSwing, MVC architecture to create a 
Settlers of Catan game board and identify the ideal placement of the initial 
game piece for a user-inputted play strategy (Commander, Producer, Explorer, etc.).

This project creates a plug-and-play experience by allowing for extension of different 
boards, terrain types, strategies, visual displays, and tile values through the use of 
interfaces and the strategy and singleton design patterns.

Currently, this application will create a random board each time it is run as a POC,
though in future iterations, I would like to allow for a user to quickly input their 
own board.

To use this application, pull the code and build with a Java editor. You will be prompted
to select a play strategy. Then, the board will be created with randomly selected tile 
placement and probability assignments. You will be able to see the results of this
with the Swing-created UI.
